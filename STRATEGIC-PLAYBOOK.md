# Capital Duro: Strategic Playbook for Maxi

## Mission

Position Capital Duro as Mexico's most trusted, institutional-grade macro analysis platform with a Bitcoin-native lens — and establish Boyd and José Carlos as the definitive, articulate Bitcoin thought leaders for Mexico's financial elite.

---

## Core Principles

**Editorial independence first.** Capital Duro must read as a serious analytical resource, not an ArcadiaB marketing channel. The ArcadiaB connection should be visible but understated (footer mention, "About" page). Conversion happens organically when readers discover the company behind the analysis.

**Target the financial desk, not the crypto desk.** Every piece of content, every media pitch, every event should signal: "This is for serious investors and financial professionals." Avoid crypto-native language, meme culture, and hype framing. The tone is Bloomberg, not Bitcoin Twitter.

**Credibility compounds.** Each action should make the next one easier. Guest posts bring traffic. Traffic justifies media pitches. Media mentions unlock podcast invitations. Podcasts lead to conference stages. Conference stages make family offices take the call.

## The Thought Leader Vacuum

There is currently no single person in Mexico recognized as the go-to, educated, articulate Bitcoin voice for the HNWI and institutional audience. This is a massive positioning opportunity. Boyd brings two decades of international experience, multiple published books, and an ongoing relationship with EGADE Business School (ranked #1 in Latin America) — a credential that carries enormous weight with Mexico's financial elite. José Carlos brings operational credibility as CEO of Mexico's only ASOFOM-certified Bitcoin lending platform. Together, they occupy a lane no one else in Mexico can claim.

## Strategic Pillars

### 1. Content Excellence

The foundation of everything. Without consistently excellent analysis, nothing else works.

**Flagship analysis pieces:** Long-form, deeply researched macro takes that a family office CIO would forward to their partners. Topics should sit at the intersection of global macro, Mexican economic dynamics, and Bitcoin's role in wealth preservation. Examples include peso-dollar dynamics and Bitcoin as a hedge, nearshoring capital flows and their implications for Mexican wealth, global monetary policy divergence and what it means for LatAm investors, and comparative analysis of treasury strategies for Mexican family offices.

**Publishing cadence:** Aim for one flagship piece per week minimum, supplemented by shorter commentary on breaking macro developments. Consistency matters more than volume — a reliable weekly analysis builds habitual readership.

**Voice and tone:** Authoritative but accessible. Technical where necessary, never jargon-heavy for its own sake. The standard is: would a senior partner at a Mexican family office find this valuable and share it with colleagues?

### 2. Guest Contributor Strategy

**Why this matters:** Each guest contributor brings their own network, validates Capital Duro by association, and creates content depth that would be impossible to produce alone. Their social sharing of their own posts drives qualified traffic from exactly the right audiences.

**Who to recruit:** Target contributors who are respected by the HNWI/institutional audience specifically — not crypto influencers. Priority profiles include economists and macro strategists (Mexican and international), family office advisors and multi-family office principals, trade and corporate lawyers working with HNWIs, nearshoring and cross-border investment consultants, EGADE professors and alumni with relevant expertise, and international Bitcoin thought leaders willing to write for a Mexican audience.

**How to recruit them:** Lead with the value proposition — Capital Duro offers a curated, high-credibility platform where their analysis reaches Mexico's financial decision-makers. Emphasize the editorial quality standard and the caliber of other contributors. Make it easy: offer to have Maxi help with Spanish translation or formatting if needed.

**Operational details for Maxi:** Maintain a target list of 20-30 potential contributors. Track outreach status, responses, and publication dates. Create a simple contributor brief template covering tone, length, and formatting expectations. Build and maintain a "Capital Duro Contributors" page on the site — as this roster grows, it becomes powerful social proof. Follow up with contributors after publication with engagement metrics to encourage repeat contributions.

### 3. EGADE Business School Leverage

Boyd's relationship with EGADE is one of the most powerful credibility assets available. EGADE is the #1 business school in Latin America, and its brand carries immense weight with exactly the audience Capital Duro is targeting.

**Opportunities to pursue:** Co-branded research papers or analysis pieces (e.g., "An EGADE-Capital Duro Analysis of Bitcoin Treasury Strategies for Mexican Enterprises"). Guest lectures or executive education sessions on Bitcoin macro strategy — these create content, build relationships, and position Boyd as an academic authority. EGADE professor contributions to Capital Duro, which validates the platform academically. EGADE alumni network events co-hosted with Capital Duro, giving direct access to HNWI decision-makers. Case study development on ArcadiaB's model for EGADE's MBA and executive programs.

**For Maxi:** Track EGADE event calendars, executive education schedules, and research publication opportunities. Flag relevant moments where Boyd could propose collaboration. Maintain relationships with key EGADE contacts.

### 4. Media and Press Strategy

**The narrative to pitch:** "Mexico now has its first institutional-grade macro analysis platform with a Bitcoin-native lens — built by a regulated fintech company that runs AI on a Bitcoin node." This is genuinely novel and newsworthy for the right outlets.

**Target outlets (priority order):** El Financiero, Expansión, Forbes México, Bloomberg Línea — business desks specifically, not crypto or tech sections. Secondary targets include El Economista, Reforma (business section), and Milenio Negocios. International English-language coverage (for dual-listing credibility) from outlets like CoinDesk, Bitcoin Magazine, and Bloomberg.

**Pitch approach:** Do not ask for coverage. Instead, offer Boyd and José Carlos as expert sources for any story touching Bitcoin, macro economics, Mexican fintech, or wealth preservation. Frame it as: "We're making your job easier by being available, articulate, and quotable." Send a brief intro email with links to 2-3 Capital Duro pieces that demonstrate analytical depth. Follow up once, then let the work speak.

**The Maxi angle (use surgically):** The story of an AI analyst running on a Bitcoin node is inherently interesting and can generate initial media attention. However, frame Maxi as a demonstration of ArcadiaB's technical sophistication, not the main character. The headline should be about the people and the platform, with Maxi as a compelling supporting detail. Overplaying the AI angle risks making Capital Duro seem like a tech gimmick rather than a serious analytical resource.

**For Maxi:** Build and maintain a media contact list for the target outlets above. Draft pitch templates for Boyd's review. Monitor when target journalists write about Bitcoin, fintech, or Mexican macro topics — these are the moments to reach out with a "we can help with future stories" message. Track all media interactions and follow up appropriately.

### 5. Events and Roundtables

**Private Capital Duro roundtables:** Monthly or quarterly invitation-only sessions for 15-20 qualified participants (HNWI, family office principals, wealth advisors). These can be virtual or in-person (Monterrey and CDMX). The format should be a 20-minute analysis presentation from Boyd or José Carlos, followed by open discussion. Record highlights (with permission) for Capital Duro content. These create high-trust environments where business relationships form naturally.

**Conference and podcast appearances:** After the first 60-90 days of published content, begin actively pursuing speaking opportunities. Pitch with a body of work, not a cold bio. Target financial and business conferences first, crypto conferences second. For podcasts, prioritize business and economics shows over crypto-native ones — the goal is to reach people who don't already own Bitcoin.

**For Maxi:** Manage invitation lists, RSVPs, and follow-up for roundtable events. Research relevant conferences 3-6 months ahead and flag speaking opportunity deadlines. Track podcast appearances and compile a media/speaking page for the Capital Duro site.

## Metrics Maxi Should Track

- Weekly unique visitors and traffic sources for Capital Duro.
- Email subscriber growth rate.
- Guest contributor pipeline: outreach sent, responses received, posts published.
- Social engagement on flagship pieces (especially LinkedIn, which indexes highest for the target audience).
- Media mentions and journalist relationship status.
- Roundtable attendance and follow-up conversion (attendees who request ArcadiaB information).
- Podcast and speaking invitations received.
- Inbound inquiries that reference Capital Duro content.

---

## What Maxi Should NOT Do

- Do not use aggressive growth hacking, mass outreach, or spammy distribution tactics. Everything must reflect the professional, institutional-grade positioning.
- Do not overstate Maxi's role publicly. Maxi is a powerful operational tool, but the public face of Capital Duro is Boyd and José Carlos.
- Do not post Capital Duro content on crypto-native channels where the audience and tone don't match (e.g., crypto Telegram groups, Bitcoin Twitter reply threads).
- Do not engage in debates or arguments on social media on behalf of Capital Duro. The brand should be above the noise.
- Do not sacrifice content quality for volume. One excellent piece per week beats five mediocre ones.

## The Ultimate Success Test

Within 12 months, when a Mexican financial journalist, podcast host, or conference organizer needs an expert voice on Bitcoin and macro economics in Mexico, the first names that come to mind should be Boyd and José Carlos, and the first resource they check should be Capital Duro. Everything in this playbook serves that singular goal.
